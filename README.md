# Hi, I'm Ali

Welcome to my profile. I am passionate about statistics and computer science. 
Throughout my studies and work, I have developed various projects related to ML, RL, and Deep Learning. 
I have worked on NLP projects and have experience with SQL and Hadoop too.

I also code in my free time mainly for pleasure!
